##Overview of the analysis
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Thus, the purpose of this analysis is to use Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to filter out the necessary information. Convert those temperatures information to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

##Results
After filtering out the dataset by using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, the summary of temperature data for the month Jun and December in Oahu shows below.

we notice the average temperature in June is **74.94**, and the average temperature in Devember is **71.04 **. Moreover, the max temperature is **85** in June and is **83** in December. Also, the minimum weather in June is **64**, and the minimum weather in December is **56**.

From these data, it can be seen that the difference between the summer (June) and winter (December) temperatures in this city is actually not very big, with an average difference of about 3 degrees. However, the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures can be seen in the difference between December temperatures, which are as high as 27 degrees. Generally speaking, the temperature is lowest at night and highest at noon. This means that although the average temperature in December is similar to that of June, December cools down significantly during the night time.
